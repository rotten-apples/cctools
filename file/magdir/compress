# compress:  file(1) magic for pure-compression formats (no archives)
#
# compress, gzip, pack, compact, huf, squeeze, crunch, freeze, yabba, etc.
#
# Formats for various forms of compressed data
# Formats for "compress" proper have been moved into "compress.c",
# because it tries to uncompress it to figure out what's inside.

# Squeeze and Crunch...
# These numbers were gleaned from the Unix versions of the programs to
# handle these formats.  Note that I can only uncrunch, not crunch, and
# I didn't have a crunched file handy, so the crunch number is untested.
