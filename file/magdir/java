# Java ByteCode
# From Larry Schwimmer (schwim@cs.stanford.edu)
#
# The Java magic number is the same as the Mach-O fat file magic number.
# Interestingly the the same guy, Mike DeMoney, of NeXT Inc. then of First
# Person (Sun) picked both numbers only a couple of years apart.  To make
# the file(1) command work with both the Java Bytecode magic was merged with
# the Mach-O magic in the file mach.
