.SH SYNOPSIS
.B file
[
.B\-f
.I list 
]
.IR filename ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I file
command performs a series of tests on each 
file argument in an attempt to classify it.  
If an argument appears to
be ASCII,
.I file
examines the first 512 bytes
and tries to guess its language.
.PP
If the argument is a fat file, the series of 
tests is performed on each
architecture in the fat file.
.PP
If the
.B \-f
option is specified, 
.I file
instead performs its tests on each file 
listed in the file
named
.IR list .
This file should contain one filename per 
line, with no whitespace.
.SH BUGS
The
.I file
command often makes mistakes.
In particular, it often suggests that command 
files are C programs.
It does not recognize Pascal or LISP.
