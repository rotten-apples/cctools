TODO:
- Change pad in PPC_THREAD_STATE to vrsave.  Print the altivec state.
- HPPA, bring the private version of mach/hppa/thread_status.h in sync with
  the kernel header and change ofile_print.c to recognize new thread states.

Changes for the 5.27 release (the cctools-751 release):
- Changed the printing of Objective-C data so that strings from protected
  sections are printed as "some string from a protected section" instead of
  what looks like junk when the protected string is printed as characters.
  Radar bug #5578032.

Changes for the 5.26 release (the cctools-750 release):
- Changed so that armv7 defaults to printing in thumb mode.  Moved in_thumb
  boolean to a global in arm_disasm.[ch] and set it to TRUE in main.c if the
  binary is armv7.  Radar bug 6651124.
- Fixed a problem with print_objc_segment() in print_objc.c that was incorrectly
  using sizeof(void *) when it should have been using sizeof(uint32_t).
  Radar bug #6652270.
- Updated ofile_print.c for the places it was missing code for
  S_16BYTE_LITERALS.  Radar bug #5947957.
- Fixed the x86_64 disassembly of with and SIB byte when mode is 0 and base is 5
  and ss is not zero so that it does not print a base register.  Radar bug
  #6533811

Changes for the 5.26 release (the cctools-749 release):
- Fixed the printing of Objective-C meta data from 64-bit object files.  So that
  every "dereference" of a pointer looks for a relocation entry.  Also added
  the -V option to print the symbol names from the relocation entries.
  Radar bug #6549235.

Changes for the 5.26 release (the cctools-737 release):
- Changed arm_r_types[] for entry 7 to T_BR32 in ofile_print.c for the new
  ARM_THUMB_32BIT_BRANCH relocation type.  Radar bug #6511482.
- In print_insn() in arm_disasm.c removed the code at the end to check for
