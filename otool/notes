Changes for the 5.10 release (the cctools-409.1 release):
- Changed print_literal8() in ofile_print.c to use:
	/* l0 is the high word, so this is equivalent to if(isfinite(d)) */
	if((l0 & 0x7ff00000) != 0x7ff00000)
  instead of:
	if(finite(d))
  so otool will not have to link with libm.  The Makefile was also changed.

Changes for the 5.10 release (the cctools-403 release):
- Removed the hack in the Makefile to use cc when $(CC) is gcc3 when linking
  to work that was working around Radar bug #2814731 now that gcc-1009 fixes it.

  to work around Radar bug #2814731.
- Changed the Makefile to not use the -dependency-file with gcc as well as
  mwccppc.
- Added an include <string.h> to m68k_disasm.c, i860_disasm.c, m88k_disasm.c,
  and ppc_disasm.c to pick up the prototype for memcpy().

Changes for the 5.8 release (the cctools-341 release):
- Changed print_immediate() in ppc_disasm.c to also check for PPC_RELOC_SECTDIFF
  as it is incorrectly printing out "Stray PPC_RELOC_PAIR relocation entry".
  This is happening because switch tables for (__TEXT,__coalesced_text) sections
  are placed in line.  This is done because ld(1) complains about illegal
  references to coalesced symbols being used with section difference relocation
  entries.

Changes for the 5.7 release (the cctools-336 release):
- Added printing NO_TOC to print_section(). Radar bug #2494286.

  print_module_table() in ofile_print.c to iinit_iterm and ninit_nterm and
  printed them as 2 numbers each.  Radar bug #2469527.

Changes for the 5.7 release (the cctools-328 release):
- Changed the Makefile so that it would use -L/usr/local/lib/system
  moving forward and -L/Local/Developer/System when RC_RELEASE is Gonzo, Bunsen
  or Beaker.

Changes for the 5.7 release (the cctools-327 release):
- Changed the Makefile so that it would use -L/AppleInternal/Developer/System
  moving forward and -L/Local/Developer/System when RC_RELEASE is Gonzo, Bunsen
  or Beaker.

Changes the 5.6 release (the cctools-320 release):
- Added support for the new LC_SUB_FRAMEWORK load command to support "Guarding
  against direct linking of non-umbrella frameworks".  The files ofile_print.c
  and ofile_print.h were updated. Radar bug 2443212.

Changes the 5.6 release (the cctools-316 release):
- Added printing the mach header flag MH_SPLIT_SEGS to ofile_print.c.

Changes the 5.5 release (the cctools-307 release):
- Fixed some bugs in print_relocs() in ofile_print.c for ppc section difference
  relocations.  It was incorrectly printing "half = 0x????\n" some times which
  lead to an extra "\n" and difficulty in determining which relocation entry an
  error message was refering to due to the extra lines in the output.
- Added support for the CPU_SUBTYPE_POWERPC_7400 in ofile_print.c .
  Radar bug #2397523.
- Fixed a bug in get_sect_info() where it was not comparing the segment name
  in an object file.  This caused it to pick the first section if their were
  segments with the same section names.

Changes the 5.4 release (the cctools-300 release):
- Added printing the new LC_ROUTINES load command.
- Added the S_COALESCED section type in section structures.

Changes the 5.3 release (the cctools-292 release):
- Added some braces to get rid of the warning message from the egcs compiler
  "warning: suggest explicit braces to avoid ambiguous `else'".  This was done
  to m68k_disasm.c, i860_disasm.c and sparc_disasm.c .
- Changed the return type of main() in main.c from void to int to remove a
  warning from the egcs compiler.  Also changed the exit()'s calls at the end to
  return()'s.

Changes for the 5.3 release, (the cctools-286 release):
- Added support for printing S_MOD_TERM_FUNC_POINTERS in print_section() in
  ofile_print.c .

Changes for the 5.3 release, (the cctools-285 release):
- Fixed the i386 opcode of cmpxchg from 0x0fa6 (as it is in the i486 manual) to
  0x0fb0 which is correct (as it is in the Pentium manual).

Changes for the 5.3 release, MacOS X bring up (the cctools-282 release):
- Changed the printing of the ppc_thread_state to not use bit fields for srr1,
  cr and exr to match the ppc_thread_state for Rhapsody/MacOS X.
- Changed the Makefile to allow for RC_OS=macos for MacOS X builds.
- Added a few casts in places to get it to compile with the MetroWerks compiler
  without -relax_pointers.
- To get around the problem with the MetroWerks compiler using -framework
  System when -static is used the Makefile was changed to if out the -static
  flag and -static link for mwcc.

Changes for the 5.2 release (the cctools-274 release):
- Removed the uses of CPU_SUBTYPE_586SX in ofile_print.c and added support for
  new intel subtypes. Radar bug #2231830.

Changes for the 5.2 release (the cctools-272 release):
- Removed the reference to the header file "objc/NXString.h" in print_objc.c as
  this file is going away.  print_objc.c now just defines the layout of struct
  objc_string_object directly.  Radar bug #2231010.

Changes for the 5.2 release (the cctools-267 release):
- Added all the suport needed for the 4.4BSD extended format #1 for long names.
  Radar bug #1670513.

Changes for the 5.1 release (the cctools-261 release):
- Added disassembling dcba to ppc_disasm.c.

  register names to match the assembler.
- Changed otool's use of CPU_SUBTYPE_POWERPC_740 to CPU_SUBTYPE_POWERPC_750.
- Fixed a bug that in processor() in main.c where indirect_symbols and
  nindirect_symbols were not initialized.  This caused printing of symbol
  stub sections to to call guess_indirect_symbol() with bad results (print
  incorrect stuff or crash).
- Fixed a bug in the ppc disasembler where it was printing the prediction of
  branch conditionals which had the BO 1z1zz (20 decimal) encoding.  See page
  4-53 of the PowerPC green book.

  comment the stub name.  Changed the ppc, i386, m68k and sparc disassemblers
  to use this.

Changes for the 5.1 release (the cctools-247 release):
- Added MKDIRS if code to the Makefile to build native on Rhapsody.
- Changed the Makefile to use gnutar instead of tar because it works on Rhapsody
  where tar does not.
- Changed the Makefile to install otool in /usr/bin for RC_OS
  teflon and in /bin for RC_OS nextstep (Radar 1673496).

- Changed print_argstrings() used for -c to use get_stack_addr_from_flag()
  from libstuff and removed all the *_usrstack.c files.
- Made otool -c work for PowerPC core files.

Changes for the 5.0 release (the cctools-224 release):
- Changed including <ranlib.h> to <mach-o/ranlib.h> which uses unsigned long

- Picked up the sparc changes to sparc_disasm.c .
- Picked up the sparc changes to sparc_r_types[] in ofile_print.c .
- Change the version numbers of dynamic library to the form X[.Y[.Z]] to match
  how next does versioning of it's projects.  This effected libtool(1), ld(1),
  otool(1), dyld, libstuff(version_number.c) and man pages for ld and libtool
  bug #55627).  In here the changes were in ofile_print.c .
- Added -T, -M, -R and -I to the usage print out.

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-156 release):
- Fixed a that caused sections with S_ATTR_PURE_INSTRUCTIONS set not to be
  disassembled.  This was casued by S_ATTR_SOME_INSTRUCTIONS also being set and
  the code in main.c checking the SECTION_ATTRIBUTES equal to 
  S_ATTR_PURE_INSTRUCTIONS and not just checking for that bit.

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-158 release):
- Fixed a bug that caused printing of shlib and dyld names to be wrong.  Basicly
  the part of the structure that needed to be swapped was copied but the
  original pointer needed to be passed to the routine to print the name part of
  the structure.  This was introduced with the change for cctools-150 below.

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-154 release):
- Added support for printing indirect symbol table entries for stripped defined
  externals.  Strip uses the values INDIRECT_SYMBOL_LOCAL and
  INDIRECT_SYMBOL_ABS to represent the symbols that are defined that were
  stripped otool prints these as LOCAL and ABSOLUTE.

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-150 release):
- Fixed a bug in printing load commands that caused the thread commands on
  hppa to be printed swapped.  This was the same bug as the otool -L bug
  below where the wrong size to memcpy was used to copy the load command.

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-149 release):
- Added printing the section attribute SOME_INSTRUCTIONS.
- Removed printing the section attribute RELOC_AT_LAUNCH.
- Added printing the mach header flag BINDATLOAD.

- Changed how otool gets built.  It how gets built with -static.

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-140 release):
- Picked up sparc changes to sparc_disasm.c.
- Added printing MH_BUNDLE filetype.

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-138 release):
- Picked up a change to sparc_disass.c.  It was getting the targets for
  branches with negative displacements wrong.

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-135 release):
- Fixed a bug in otool for sparc disassembly in the routine print_symbolic()
  which printed the wrong value for branch instructions when relocation entries
  were not present.  The problem was it was adding in the pc to the target
  value which already had the pc added to it.
- Fix for Tracker 41317 [as(hppa) : does not support cache control hints.]
  otool/hppa-dissasm.c changed to disassemble the new parsing rule changes.

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-133 release):
- Picked up the sparc changes to sparc_disasm.c.
- Picked up the sparc changes for printing the floating-point sparc thread.

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-132 release):
- Picked up the sparc changes for sparc_disasm.c and m88k_disasm.c.
- Picked up the sparc changes for printing the sparc thread.

Changes for the 3.3 release (the cctools-128 release):
- Fixed otool -c for the hppa.  Had to add special code in print_argstrings()
  in main.c to deal with the different stack layout (bug #40373).
- Removed the spaces printed before the register names for the hppa disassembler
  in 4 places.

Changes for the 3.3 release (the cctools-127 release):
- Fixed a bug when the a zero fill section was attempted to be printed without
  -v which caused otool to core dump (bug #42127).

Changes for the 3.3 release (the cctools-122 release):
- Fixed a bug in printed byte swapped tocs for a dylib.  The code in main.c
  had some copy and paste errors in it's allocate() and memcpy() before the
  call to swap_dylib_table_of_contents().

Changes for the 3.3 release (the cctools-119 release):
- Picked up first round of changes for the sparc target.  This work is
  incomplete.
- HPPA, changed main.c, otool.h, ofile_print.c and Makefile to fix bug # 39398
  (otool does not understand certain thread states for hppa). Added
  hppa_usrstack.c for the same.

Changes for the 3.3 release (the cctools-115 release):
- Changed print_symbol() in ofile_print.c to take an extra parameter, dot_value,
  the value of the address being dissassembled which is only used for the value
  of the -symbol in a SECTDIFF relocation entry if their is no symbol that
  matches that value.

Changes for the 3.3 release (the cctools-104 release):
- Made a quick but incorrect fix for jbsr disassembly in hppa_disasm.c by
  passing the sect_addr as the first parameter to print_immediate() in the
  jbsr case '@' this will not work if a jbsr to a different section is used.

Changes for the 3.3 release (the cctools-103 release):
- Fixed a bug in hppa_r_types[] array which has only 15 (not 16 enties).

Changes for the 3.3 release (the cctools-102 release):
- Integrated in the hppa support.
different otool/Makefile (integrated for cctools-102)
     Using cctoolshppa-37.  New hppa files. Changed to remove hppa-opcode.h.
different otool/i386_usrstack.c (no changes for cctools-102)
     Using cctools-29. Late 3.2 fixes the hppa base did not have.
different otool/m68k_usrstack.c (no changes for cctools-102)
     Using cctools-29. Late 3.2 fixes the hppa base did not have.
different otool/main.c (integrated for cctools-102)
     Using cctoolshppa-37.  Call to hppa_disassemble() added.
different otool/ofile_print.c (integrated for cctools-102)
     Using cctoolshppa-37.  Printing hppa cputypes and relocs added.
     Fixed some print space problems in the master clone ~comp/cctools-29.
Only in cctoolshppa-37/otool: hppa_disasm.c (integrated for cctools-102)
     Pickup cctoolshppa-37/otool/hppa_disasm.c from cctoolshppa-37 and
     Changed line 9 from:
	#include "hppa-opcode.h"
     to
	#include "../as/hppa-opcode.h"
     Changed line 412 from:
	struct scattered_relocation_info *srp, *spairp;
     to
	struct scattered_relocation_info *srp;
     to remove a warning.
     Changed line 630 from:
	return HPPA_RELOC_NORELOC;
     to
	return 0xffffffff;
     since HPPA_RELOC_NORELOC was removed from mach-o/hppa/reloc.h
   Changes for cctools-102:
     moved some functions into libstuff/hppa.c as suggested by the comments.
Only in cctoolshppa-37/otool: hppa_disasm.h (integrated for cctools-102)
     Pickup cctoolshppa-37/otool/hppa_disasm.h from cctoolshppa-37.
Only in cctoolshppa-37/otool: hppa-opcode.h (also NOT pick up for cctools-102)
     This is simmilar but different to hppa-opcode.h in ../as .  This was not
     picked up but hppa_disasm.c was changed to include ../as/hppa-opcode.h

Changes for the 3.3 release (the cctools-101 release):
- Made sections with the attribute S_ATTR_PURE_INSTRUCTIONS disassemble with
  the -v flag.  Also had to fix the disassemblers to add sect_addr parameter to
  subract from the address when looking for relocation entries.
- Added -I to print the indirect symbol tables.
- Added code to print the dysymtab.

Changes for the 3.3 release (the cctools-100 release):
- First major round of changes for the new shlib stuff.
  1) In otool's disassemblers (m68k and i386) support for possition-independent 
     code through the SECTDIFF relocataion type.
- Fixed a bug in the m68k disassembler for mulsl where the 2 register form did
  not disassemble the Dl register correctly (bug #38530).
- Fixed a bug in the m68k disassembler for bcc branches of 16-bit and 8-bit
  displacements not getting their target calculated correctly (bug #38531).
- Fixed a bug in the m68k disassembler for dbcc instructions where the 16-bit
  displacements were not getting their target calculated correctly.

Changes for the 3.2 release (the cctools-24 release):
- Fixed a bug in print_argstrings() which was using printf(%s) and that could
  not correctly deal with a string that did not end in a '\0' before the memory
  that contained the string ended (bug #33672).

Changes for the 3.1 release (the cctools-22 release):
- Added printing for these  (bug #32553):
    { "any",	CPU_TYPE_ANY,	  CPU_SUBTYPE_MULTIPLE },
    { "little",	CPU_TYPE_ANY,	  CPU_SUBTYPE_LITTLE_ENDIAN },
    { "big",	CPU_TYPE_ANY,	  CPU_SUBTYPE_BIG_ENDIAN },

Changes for the 3.1 release (the cctools-21 release):
- Fixed a few bugs in print_objc.c the had arguments reversed so things got
  swapped when they shouldn't have.

Changes for the 3.1 release (the cctools-15 release):
- Flushed out the swap_* stubs in print_objc.c.
- Updated the printing of the m98k cpu flavor to use it's correct definition.

Changes for the 3.1 release (the cctools-14 release):
- Added the opcodes for tlbiex (31,338) and tlbia (31,370).
- Changed the m98k instructions: lwarx, ldarx, stwcx. and stdcx. second arg from
  just a greg to 0 or a greg (r1-r31).
- For the m98k disassembler removed "mr" for "ori Rx,Ry,0" because the 0 could
  have a relocation entry and it really could be an "ori" not a "mr" (move
  register).

Changes for the 3.1 release (the cctools-13 release):
- Added the m98k (PowerPC) architecture.  This includes a kludged
  mach/m98k/thread_status.h with only an entry point.

Changes for the 3.1 release (the cctools-10 release):
- Fixed two bugs in the i386 disassembler.  First the displacement routine
  needed to sign extend it's value if it was a byte or short before doing the
  addition.  Second for the 8-bit jumps the operand size needs to be printed
  as a long not a byte (bug #29789).

Changes for the 3.1 release (the cctools-9 release):
- Fixed otool -c for the m88k and i386 architectures (bug #29639).  This
  required a file for each arch that included <bsd/XXXX/vmparam.h> so the value
  of USRSTACK could be returned.

Changes for the 3.1 release (the cctools-8 release):
- Added symbolic disassembly for the i386 arch.  This involved a major clean up
  of i386_disasm.c .

Changes for the 3.1 release (the cctools-7 release):
- Added the i485 and i586 instructions to the dissembler for the i386 arch.
- Added a comment character '#' before in the sprintf lines
  "#***** Error - bad opcode" in _bits.c for disassembling the i386.

Changes for the 3.1 release (the cctools-5 release):
- Picked up the lono team's mods to ofile_print.c for changes to the i386
  thread_status.h.

Changes for the 3.1 release (the cctools-4 release):
- Changed the arch name from ix86 to i386.
- Changed CPU_TYPE_I80x86 to CPU_TYPE_I386 in main.c that was missed.

Changes for the 3.1 release (the cctools-3 release):
- Changed CPU_TYPE_I80x86 to CPU_TYPE_I386 and removed CPU_SUBTYPE_AT386
  CPU_SUBTYPE_EXL .

Changes for the 3.1 release (the cctools-1 release)
- Created the otool directory with the 3.1 otool.
