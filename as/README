Generally, the GNU Assembler (GAS) is built as part of the cctools project and
resides in the 'as' directory.  However, it is possible to copy only the GAS
sources to a separate directory, and compile GAS standalone using the following
commands:

$ make installGASsrc SRCROOT=/tmp/gas
$ cd /tmp/gas
$ make fromGASsrc
