TODO for coalesced symbols:
- Should external relocation entries for defined coalesced symbols only be
  created with -dynamic and not -static?

TODO:
- Add MacOS line termination \r .

Known bugs:
- The assembly line:
	bl ""foo""
  causes the symbol name "" to be used.
- cmpwi seems to be the same as cmpi for PowerPC.
