TODO:
- Should add a -no_fix_prebinding flag to ld(1) so fix_prebinding can be
  built with it.
- MH_BUNDLEs should have a two-level namespace hint table by default or at
  least with MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET 10.2 (the -twolevel_namespace_hints flag).
  Note this is only a problem with 10.0 which is NOT a deployment target.
- Test coalesced symbols with -static code gen and with rld()?
- Might be a bug in search_dynamic_libs() if it is searching an archive then
  it does not take into account -all_load or -Objc.
- The sreloc->r_address field is only 24-bits (16 meg) and can overflow
  producing bad relocation entries in the output file.  To test for this a
  handful of checks would need to be added to the *_reloc.c file after
  update_reloc and other files that put out relocation entries.
- The LC_PREBOUND_DYLIB commands do not have the modules used via N_INDR
  symbols marked in the linked_modules bit vector.
- Add check for undefined dyld_stub_binding_helper and __dyld_func_lookup if
  output_for_dyld is set.
- Think about how indirect section would be ordered if allowed.

Build problems:
- For i386 builds with -dynamic -fomit-frame-pointer produces bad code (bug
  #52986)
- For m68k builds -finline-functions crashes the compiler (used in the Makefile
  on the ld_build target).

Changes for the 5.26 release (the cctools-738 release):
- Removed the code and files for the old ProjectBuilder interface including the
  use of mig(1) in the Makefile.  The files make.defs make_defs.h were removed
  and the code in ld.c, pass1.c and symbols.c  had the code with these old
  interfaces removed.  Radar bug #6457206.
- Added support for the arm ARM_THUMB_32BIT_BRANCH relocation entry.  Radar bug
  #6511482.

Changes for the 5.26 release (the cctools-721 release):
- Changed the Makefile and removed -force_cpusubtype_ALL from KERN.  Radar bug
  #6233829.

Changes for the 5.26 release (the cctools-711 release):
- Changed the Makefile so -D__DARWIN_UNIX03=__arm__ is always added to KERN
  Radar bug #6098280.

Changes for the 5.26 release (the cctools-705 release):
- Code changes for other code to work on 64-bit hosts:   Radar bug #6022298.
  - Changed the types of the local variables hi21, lo14, w, w1, and w2 in
    hppa_reloc in hppa_reloc.c from unsigned long to uint32_t .
  - Added a cast to (int *) for the assignment of output_thread_info
    entry_point and stack_pointer for the arm thread state.
  - Changed the types of dylib_current_version, dylib_compatibility_version,
    nremove_symbols and nsave_symbols from unsigned long to uint32_t in ld.[ch].
    Changed the use of %lu to %u for these in ld.c .

Changes for the 5.26 release (the cctools-699 release):
- Changed uuid.c to directly call uuid_generate_random() without the dynamic
  lookup.  Radar bug #5620031.

Changes for the 5.25 release (the cctools-695 release):
- Changed the Makefile to use -iwithsysroot as part of the KERN flags.

Changes for the 5.25 release (the cctools-681 release):
- Removed all __OPEN_SOURCE__ references in Makefile, notes, objects.c,
  objects.h, sections.c, symbols.c, layout.c, ld.c and arm_reloc .

Changes for the 5.25 release (the cctools-679.3 release):
- Changed the Makefile to test OLD_LIBKLD pass down from the upper Makefile
  so to not build libkld when OLD_LIBKLD is NO.  Radar bug #5698612.

Changes for the 5.25 release (the cctools-677 release):
- Changed the Makefile to not use -Wno-long-double and -no-cpp-precomp .
  Radar bug #5563553.

Changes for the 5.25 release (the cctools-676 release):
- Changed check_cur_obj() in pass1.c to know about S_DTRACE_DOF section types
  enough to not cause an error about unknown section type.

Changes for the 5.25 release (the cctools-673 release):
- Changed the sources so the arm stuff is not in the open source version.
  Radar bug #5326431.
  - Changed the Makefile to #ifndef __OPEN_SOURCE__ out the arm files
  - Added #ifndef __OPEN_SOURCE__ to the following files to bracket arm code:
    layout.c, ld.c, objects.c, objects.h, sections.c, symbols.c and arm_reloc.c.

Changes for the 5.24 release (the cctools-663 release):
- Changed the code in ld.[ch], pass1.c, symbols.c, layout.c and pass2.c for
  the new get_macosx_deployment_target() interface.  Radar bug #5132019.

Changes for the 5.24 release (the cctools-662 release):
- Changed kld so it will propagate the LC_UUID from the last object file being
  linked into the output.  Radar bug #5137807.
  - Changed check_cur_obj() in pass1.c for #ifdef KLD to always clear the
    output_uuid_info to zeros and then if the object file being checked has an
    LC_UUID command copy that into the output_uuid_info.
  - Changed layout() in layout.c for #ifndef KLD so it does not clear the
    output_uuid_info and create the uuid load command if the
    output_uuid_info.uuid_command.cmdsize is non-zero.

Changes for the 5.24 release (the cctools-653 release):
- Backed out the change for Radar bug #4930693 in internal_kld_load() in kld.c
  to #ifdef KLD so that RLD_DEBUG_OUTPUT_FILENAME_flag is always set to 1.  This
  was causing problems the way the prelinked kernel is generated.  Radar bug
  #4930693.
- Updated dylibs.c and pass1.c to handle the LC_REEXPORT_DYLIB load command.
  Radar bug #4986624.

Changes for the 5.24 release (the cctools-651 release):
- Changed pass1() in pass1.c to swap the load command part of load commands
