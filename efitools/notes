TODO:
Add flags for:
  -debug
  -no_dos_header
Add support for:
- Remove empty __IMPORT segment

Changes for the 5.25 release (the cctools-688 release):
- Fixed a problem in mtoc(1) selection of the address for the .reloc PECOFF
  section.  To work around the unified linker incorrectly producing a LINKEDIT
  segment the code in process_32bit_arch() and process_64bit_arch() needed to
  ingore this segment when selecting the address.

Changes for the 5.25 release (the cctools-687 release):
- Added 64-bit checking for undefined symbols. 

Changes for the 5.25 release (the cctools-686 release):
- Added the "-section_alignment <hex_value>" option.  This should be passed the
  same value as passed to the linker in the -segalign value when creating the
  Mach-O file. This value is used to layout the added .reloc section and set
  into the PECOFF aouthdr.
- Added a check to make sure the headers are not mapped on top of its sections. 
  If it does you get an error message saying the Mach-O needed to be relinked
  and the -seg1addr value to use.
- Added alternate names for the subsystem arguments.
- Added checking for undefined symbols (32-bit only).

Changes for the 5.25 release (the cctools-685 release):
- Updated mtoc(1) to deal with MH_EXECUTE file types and MH_PIE flag.

Changes for the 5.25 release (the cctools-681 release):
- Added the new mtoc(1) program to the cctools project.  Radar bug #5536661.
  - The -e entry_point is a temporary hack until 64-bit files are produced
    with MH_PRELOAD and have an entry point in the thread command.
- The makerelocs(1) program in here is not installed as it would overwrite the
  existing one in the efitools project.  But this one could replace it but the
  new mtoc(1) program includes that and makes it obsolete.  But is useful to
  test with.
